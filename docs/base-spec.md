# Choose Your Own Adventure Markdown engine

We want to make a Nextjs webapp that can take a markdown file or files, and present the user with a 'choose your own adventure' or twine style of interactive experience.

We will have to define the format for these Markdown files in terms of how the choices a user makes on a page are defined, and how we define links between pages.

We should follow Nextjs best practices when developing this.
