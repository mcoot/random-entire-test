# The Treasure Room

You discover a hidden chamber filled with golden light. Ancient coins spill from wooden chests. Jeweled weapons hang on the walls. A crown sits on a velvet cushion atop a stone pedestal.

As you step forward, you realize the light comes not from torches but from the treasure itself — each piece glowing with a faint, warm luminescence.

You have found the heart of the forest's magic. The adventure is complete.

**The End.**
