# The Dark Woods

You follow the sound of water northward. The canopy thickens overhead, casting deep shadows across the forest floor. The stream appears — clear and cold, winding between mossy stones.

As you follow its bank, you notice something glinting beneath the water. A half-submerged chest rests in the shallows, its iron lock rusted but intact.

Nearby, a narrow trail leads deeper into the woods where the trees grow impossibly close together.

```choices
- [Open the chest](treasure-room)
- [Follow the narrow trail deeper](village-gate)
- [Return to the clearing](start)
```
