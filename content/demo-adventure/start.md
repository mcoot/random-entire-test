# The Forest Clearing

You awaken in a sun-dappled clearing deep within an ancient forest. Tall oaks surround you, their branches swaying gently in the breeze. The air smells of moss and wildflowers.

To the north, you hear the sound of rushing water — a stream, perhaps. To the east, faint voices carry through the trees, accompanied by the smell of wood smoke.

What do you do?

```choices
- [Follow the stream north](dark-woods)
- [Head toward the voices](village-gate)
```
