# The Village Gate

You emerge from the tree line to find a small village nestled in a valley. A wooden palisade surrounds a cluster of thatched-roof cottages. Smoke rises from chimneys and the sound of a blacksmith's hammer rings out.

An old woman sitting by the gate looks up as you approach. "A traveler! We don't get many visitors these days. The woods have grown dangerous." She gestures toward the forest behind you.

"If you're looking for fortune, there's a cave beyond the northern stream. But be careful — not all treasure is what it seems."
